# Rcode_measurement-error-and-misclassification

The folders and the R code help to reproduce Tables 1-2 and Tables S1-S5  in the article "Logistic regression with correlated measurement error and misclassification in covariates"  by Zhiqiang Cao, Man Yu Wong and Garvin H.L. Cheng (under review)

For questions or comments about the code, please contact Zhiqiang Cao<zcaoae@connect.ust.hk>

I. amle4.mis_setup.R is to compute score and variance of ALE estimators
2. simulation_tables_1_2.R is to reproduce estimation results in Tables 1 and 2, as well as Tables S1 and S2
3. simulation_table_S3.R is to reproduce estimation results in Table S3
4. simulation_table_S4_S5.R is to reproduce estimation results in Table S4 and S5
